        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This japanese dish is scrumptious and a perfect comfort dish you can
            make for the rest of the week to eat by itself or with rice! It's a meat
            and starchy combination packed together with panko breadcrumbs and
            deep fried to get a crunchy exterior and a smooth but tasty inside.
